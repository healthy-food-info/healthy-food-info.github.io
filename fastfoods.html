            <p>The fast food recipe i have chosen can be found <a href="https://www.taste.com.au/recipes/beef-burgers-double-fried-chips/2575aa98-e2d6-491d-9cb4-a4a889e569bf">here</a>. This is a recipe for a beef burger with chips. I really like burgers, although they are not very healthy. There are a number of modifications you can make in order to make it more healthy.<br>
                <br>
                Firstly, this recipe uses fatty beef. Fat in beef is one of the most common saturated fats, and there is a lot of it in fatty beef. Saturated fats are very bad as they increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, and raise cholesterol levels. If you use lean beef instead, there are less fats and the burger is more healthy.<br>
                <br>
                The recipe also uses brioche rolls. Brioche rolls are high in sugar and low in fibre, which is very unhealthy. An alternative to this would be to use wholemeal rolls. Wholemeal rolls are more satisfying, so they will keep you satisfied for longer, as well as being healthier.<br>
                <br>
                Frying the beef with lots of oil is very bad for you. Instead you can cook the beef in the air fryer to avoid using oil. Oil is bad for your body as it is a processed food and contains a lot of fats.<br>
                <br>
                To make the burger even healthier, you can make a homemade tomato relish to add to the burger instead of creamy tartare sauce. You can add extra salad to the burger, which adds extra nutrients and fibre. Lastly, you can serve with crunchy carrot, celery and capsicum sticks instead of chips. This reduces fat and salt, and adds nutrients and fibre.</p>
